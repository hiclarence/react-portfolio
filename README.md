From the search screen you have two options.  The user can select a beer at random with the roulette button, or can enter in a food into the search bar.  After selecting either of these options, you will be presented with a matching beer and food pairing.  A brief description of the beer, and a group of recommend food pairings are provided to the user to explore.
